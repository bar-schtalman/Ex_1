Ariel OOP - Weighted Graph

this project present weighted graph(from vertex to graph algorithm)

project classes:

WGraph_DS (contain Node class) -> this class implements node_info.java and weighted_graph.java

and represnt a graph builder including all methods(add vertex,remove vertex,add edge,remove edge...etc)

WGraph_Algo -> this class implements weighted_graph_algorithms.java

and represent algorithms over Graphs(check if graph is connected, shortest path from src-dist...etc)

the Data structure i used is HashMap, providing better runing times, most of the methods(remove,add,contain,get...etc) are runing in O(1)
